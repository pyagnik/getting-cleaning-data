Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project Introduction

This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.

Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Project Requirement

1) a tidy data set as described below
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md 
4)README.md

About the raw data

The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file. The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.

The same holds for the training set.

About the script and the tidy dataset

I created a script called run_analysis.R which perform following steps to get output 
Step - 01> Setup working directory 
Step - 02> Download the file and store in directory 
Step - 03> Unzip the file 
Step - 04> Get the Data in R : Getting list of unziped file from "UCHI HAR dataset" 
Step - 05> Reading data from files into variable 
Step - 06> Binding row by using rbind 
Step - 07> Set_variable: 
Step - 08> Combine Column by using cbind 
Step - 09> Subset Name of Features by measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
Step - 10> Subset the data frame Data by seleted names of Features 
Step - 11> Read descriptive activity names from ï¿½activity_labels.txt 
Step - 12> Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
Step - 13> In this part,a second, independent tidy data set will be created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

So, the code starts from setting up working directory and ending with "tidydata" output

About the Code Book Above Code step are briefly explained in Code Book The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
